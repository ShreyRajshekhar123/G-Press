# IMPORTANT: Adjust this path if your Firebase Admin SDK JSON key file is elsewhere
# Example: If it's in your Server folder or a config subfolder
Server/.env         # If you have a .env specific to your Server folder
Server/serviceAccountKey.json # Common name for Firebase Admin SDK key
Server/firebase-admin-sdk-key.json # Another possible name for the Firebase Admin SDK key
# Explicitly ignore the Firebase Admin SDK key file with its exact name

# Note on src/firebase.js:
# This file should typically NOT be ignored as it contains your public Firebase client configuration
# and is part of your application's source code. If it contains sensitive information,
# that information should be moved to environment variables (.env files, which ARE ignored)
# and referenced in src/firebase.js using process.env.REACT_APP_VARIABLE_NAME.
